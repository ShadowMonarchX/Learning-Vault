Perfect — you want a **full roadmap** from **idea to pre-seed funding (\$2M–\$3M)** as **two co-founders** with no other team. This is absolutely doable — many top AI startups started just like this. The key is showing **deep user need, unique insight, fast prototype**, and a clear plan to scale.

Here’s your **complete step-by-step journey** — broken into **5 Phases**, from **Day 1** to **Funding Closed**.

---

# 🛣️ Full Path to \$2M–\$3M Pre-Seed (for 2 Founders, AI Agent Startup)

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1–3)

### 🎯 Goal: Define Problem + Market Clearly

1. **Pick Your Problem Niche**
   ✅ Example: “SMBs waste hours every week manually updating CRM, sending reports & follow-ups.”
   → Solve this with AI Agents + SaaS integration (your FlowMate AI concept).

2. **Market Research**

   * Estimate market size: Use reports (Gartner, Statista, McKinsey).
   * Understand TAM (Total Addressable Market) for B2B automation, AI assistants, CRM tools.

3. **Customer Research**

   * Interview 30–50 SMB decision-makers:

     * Use Google Forms, Calendly, cold outreach, LinkedIn DMs.
     * Ask what’s painful, how they solve it, how much they’d pay.

4. **Document Pain**

   * Record every quote.
   * Use Airtable / Notion to track.

---

## ⚒️ Phase 2: Prototype + Validation (Week 4–8)

### 🎯 Goal: Build something small that shows the solution works

1. **Design Small Prototype**

   * Build a simple app or chatbot (LangChain / GPT API + Streamlit/React).
   * Show it auto-fills CRM or drafts email follow-ups from meeting summaries.

2. **Test with Users**

   * Ask 5–10 interviewees to try the prototype.
   * Record usage feedback.

3. **Collect Testimonials**

   * Document outcomes:

     * “Saved me 5 hours this week.”
     * “This should be in HubSpot by default.”

---

## 📊 Phase 3: Traction + Pitch Prep (Week 9–14)

### 🎯 Goal: Show traction, polish story, prepare to raise

1. **Build Pre-Seed Pitch Deck**

   * Slides: Problem, Solution, Market Size, Product Demo, Business Model, Traction, Team, Vision, Ask.

2. **Get Early Waitlist Signups**

   * Create landing page (Carrd/Webflow).
   * Add waitlist + early access form.
   * Share on LinkedIn, Reddit, Indie Hackers.

3. **Show Early Metrics**

   * Even small traction: 200+ signups, 10 pilot users, 5 customer calls = good signs.

4. **Incorporate Company**

   * Register (e.g., Delaware C-Corp).
   * Use Stripe Atlas, AngelList Stack, or Clerky.

---

## 💰 Phase 4: Fundraising (Month 4–5)

### 🎯 Goal: Raise \$2M–\$3M Pre-Seed from Angel/VCs

1. **Build Investor List**

   * Focus: AI-focused angels, SaaS early-stage VCs (e.g., Afore, First Round, Village Global).
   * Use tools: Signal, Crunchbase, Twitter, warm intros via LinkedIn.

2. **Start Outreach**

   * Send short emails/DMs:
     *“Hey \[Investor], I’m building FlowMate AI — an agentic AI for SMBs to automate CRM and reporting tasks. We validated with 50+ users and have a working prototype. Can I share more?”*

3. **Pitch Meetings**

   * Focus on story: Big painful problem + your unique approach + early traction + clear use of funds.

4. **Negotiate Terms**

   * SAFEs (Y Combinator standard).
   * Valuation: Typically \$6M–\$12M pre-money for \$2M–\$3M raise.

---

## 🚀 Phase 5: Post-Funding Execution (Month 6+)

### 🎯 Goal: Build MVP, hire team, grow user base

1. **Use Funds Smartly**

   * Hiring: 2 engineers, 1 PM/designer, 1 go-to-market person.
   * Product: Fully launch MVP with key workflows + integrations.
   * GTM: Launch on Product Hunt, run ads, do partnerships.

Let’s move to execution 🚀










Great! Targeting **\$2M to \$3M pre-seed funding** is ambitious but definitely possible if you approach it smartly. To justify this amount, you need to **deeply identify and validate a complex, high-value problem** and present a strong, scalable solution.

Here’s a clear plan to **research and deeply identify your startup’s core problem** and prepare to raise \$2M–\$3M pre-seed:

---

# How to Identify & Deeply Research Your Startup Problem for High Pre-Seed Funding

---

## 1. Define Your Problem Scope Precisely

* Start with your broad problem area, e.g., **business workflow overload in SMBs**.
* Break it down into **specific pain points** that cause the biggest friction. Examples:

  * CRM data errors & manual entry waste hours daily
  * Sales teams spend 30%+ time on admin vs selling
  * Managers lack real-time workflow visibility causing delays

---

## 2. Quantify the Problem with Data

* Collect **quantitative data**:

  * Time wasted on manual workflow tasks (surveys, reports)
  * Financial losses from inefficiencies (e.g., delayed sales, errors)
  * Market size numbers from reports (Gartner, McKinsey, Forrester)
* This will build your **business case and market size**, which investors want.

---

## 3. Conduct Deep Customer Interviews & Surveys

* Interview **30–50 SMB owners, sales managers, knowledge workers** across industries.
* Prepare **detailed interview questions**:

  * How much time do you spend on repetitive workflows?
  * What tools do you currently use? Pain points?
  * What would an ideal AI assistant do to help?
  * How much would you pay for such a solution?
* Record pain stories, unmet needs, and willingness to pay.

---

## 4. Analyze Competitors & Alternatives

* List all current solutions: automation tools, CRM plugins, AI assistants.
* Identify **gaps where they fail** (complexity, cost, lack of AI-driven intelligence).
* Show why your AI agent approach is uniquely positioned to solve these.

---

## 5. Define Your Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

* Based on the research, craft a sharp UVP:
  *“FlowMate AI saves SMB sales teams 10+ hours/week by automating CRM updates, reports, and follow-ups — without coding or costly consultants.”*
* This should address the biggest pain you validated.

---

## 6. Build a Research Report / Pitch Appendix

* Summarize:

  * Market size & growth trends
  * Customer pain points and quotes
  * Competitor analysis & differentiation
  * Financial impact (time & money saved)
* This adds credibility and confidence for investors.

---

## 7. Prepare Your Pre-Seed Pitch

* Problem + market + solution + traction (prototype/user feedback) + go-to-market plan
* Highlight your deep research, unique insights, and why \$2M+ is needed now to build scalable AI & integrations.

---

# Why Aim for \$2M to \$3M Pre-Seed?

* You can afford to **build a strong MVP with multiple integrations and AI sophistication**.
* You can **hire experienced engineers and AI specialists** early.
* You can invest in **pilot customers & sales/marketing**, speeding growth.
* It signals serious ambition and allows faster scaling.

---

# Key Tips for Success

* **Show real customer pain & demand** — this is #1
* Demonstrate a clear **path to scale & revenue**
* Have a **strong founding team or advisors** with AI/product/market experience
* Be ready to explain **how you’ll use the funds to hit milestones**

---

If you want, I can help you create:

* A **customer interview guide + survey template** for deep research
* A **competitive landscape analysis**
* A **pre-seed pitch deck outline** tailored to your problem research

---

Would you like to start with **customer interview questions** or maybe an example **market research summary**?
