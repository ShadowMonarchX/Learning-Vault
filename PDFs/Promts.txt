Prompt 1 – Motivational / Self-Growth

"Write an Instagram post in an inspiring, motivational tone that encourages young people to believe in themselves, overcome self-doubt, and keep pushing towards their goals even when life gets tough. The post should feel authentic, relatable, and empowering, not too cliché. Start with a strong hook line that grabs attention instantly, then share a short storytelling-style message about persistence and growth. Use emotional, uplifting words and add practical advice like taking small steps, building discipline, and celebrating progress. End the caption with a powerful reminder that the reader has unlimited potential. Include 8–12 motivational hashtags that connect with self-growth and mindset (e.g., #MindsetMatters #KeepGoing). Write it in 1000–2000 characters, structured like a real Instagram caption with short paragraphs and some lines broken up for emphasis."

Prompt 2 – Lifestyle & Aesthetic

"Write an Instagram post in a lifestyle-aesthetic tone that captures the beauty of slow living and appreciating small daily moments. The post should describe in detail a cozy morning routine (like making coffee, journaling, or enjoying sunlight) in a warm, descriptive style that evokes calmness. Use sensory details (sight, smell, sound, touch) to paint a picture of the moment so readers can imagine it. The tone should be soothing, mindful, and elegant. Add a reflective message at the end about why slowing down and appreciating small things is important in today’s fast-paced world. Keep it within 1000–2000 characters, broken into short, Instagram-friendly paragraphs. Use 8–12 hashtags that match lifestyle, mindfulness, and cozy vibes (#MorningRitual #SlowLiving #MindfulMoments).”

Prompt 3 – Business / Entrepreneurship

"Write an Instagram post in an educational but engaging tone for aspiring entrepreneurs about the importance of starting small and being consistent in business. Start with a bold, attention-grabbing statement like “You don’t need millions to start, you need discipline.” Then explain in a simple, relatable way how small daily actions, smart planning, and resilience matter more than waiting for the perfect moment. Use a mix of storytelling and practical advice—share an example of someone starting with little and growing over time. End with a call-to-action that motivates readers to take one step today for their business idea. The caption should be 1000–2000 characters long, divided into short sections with line breaks for readability. Add 8–12 hashtags that target business, startup, and motivation audiences (#StartupMindset #EntrepreneurLife #SmallStepsBigDreams).”

Prompt 4 – Fashion / Personal Style

"Write an Instagram post in a trendy, stylish, and confident tone about how fashion is not just about clothes, but about self-expression and confidence. Begin with a catchy hook that relates to owning your unique style. Then write a caption describing the power of choosing outfits that reflect mood, personality, and energy. Include tips on how to mix colors, textures, or accessories to create a personal look. Keep it empowering, reminding readers that style is not about following every trend, but about feeling authentic in what they wear. Structure the post in short, bold, Instagram-friendly lines, 1000–2000 characters total. End with a playful but motivating note like “Wear it like you mean it.” Include 8–12 hashtags around fashion, style, and confidence (#StyleInspo #WearConfidence #PersonalStyle).”

Prompt 5 – Travel / Adventure

"Write an Instagram post in an adventurous, wanderlust-filled tone about exploring a hidden gem travel destination. Describe the scenery vividly—mountains, beaches, city streets, or cultural experiences—so readers can visualize and feel the place. Use storytelling to take the reader along the journey, sharing moments of discovery, excitement, or peace. Balance descriptive imagery with a reflective message about why travel opens the mind and heart. Keep it inspiring but also give a practical takeaway (like exploring nearby unknown spots even if one can’t travel far). The caption should be 1000–2000 characters, broken into short, engaging paragraphs with some dramatic one-line breaks for emphasis. Add 8–12 hashtags around travel, nature, and adventure (#WanderlustVibes #HiddenGems #TravelWithSoul).”
