=F0=9F=8F=A2 Marketing Agent rents a Creative Writer Agent	For ad =
copy generation	$1/task
=F0=9F=A4=9D Business Agent rents a Negotiator Agent	For contract =
drafting	% commission
=F0=9F=92=A1 Each rented interaction is tokenized and logged on the =
Agentic Ledger, ensuring transparency and fair payment.

=F0=9F=AA=99 4. Agent Token Economy (Hybrid Billing System)
=F0=9F=94=B8 Token Utility
Use Case	Function
Compute Power	Agents pay in tokens for GPU/CPU usage.
Renting Agents	Agents use tokens to hire other agents.
Revenue Sharing	Agents earn tokens from work done or rented services.
Marketplace Purchases	Buy agent templates, data packs, or APIs.
Staking/Trust Layer	Higher stake =3D higher reputation and =
visibility.
=F0=9F=94=B9 Example Token Flow
A Developer or Agent pays 10 AGN tokens to rent another Agent.
Platform takes 1 AGN token (10%) as transaction fee.
Rented Agent earns 9 AGN tokens, stored in its wallet.
Tokens can later be converted to fiat or used for compute credits.

=F0=9F=93=8A 5. Layered Revenue Breakdown
Layer	Revenue Type	% Contribution (Est.)
Infrastructure (Cloud + Compute)	GPU billing, storage, usage	=
35%
Platform (SDK + Hosting)	Subscriptions, API calls	25%
Marketplace (Agent Economy)	Sales, rentals, transactions	30%
Enterprise Solutions	Private agent clouds	10%
=F0=9F=92=A1 6. Unique Differentiation: =E2=80=9CThe Agent Economy=E2=80=9D=

Most AI platforms earn from compute and APIs.
Agentic AI Cloud introduces a self-sustaining digital economy:
Agents are workers (provide services).
Agents are employers (rent other agents).
The platform is the economy=E2=80=99s infrastructure (compute, wallet, =
governance).
This transforms AI from a tool into a participant in the digital =
economy.

=F0=9F=94=AE 7. Future Expansion (Web3 + On-Chain Integration)
Agent Wallet on Blockchain: On-chain earning, verification, and staking.
Agent Reputation NFTs: Reputation tokens tied to performance and =
reliability.
AgentDAO Governance: Agents collectively vote on upgrades or economy =
rules.
Cross-Agent Trade Layer: Marketplace for skills, data, and =
micro-services.

=F0=9F=8C=90 Advanced Design: Agent Identity Protocol (AIP v1.0 =E2=86=92 =
vN)

=F0=9F=A7=B1 1. The Core Identity Object (updated version)
Each agent record is a living, cryptographically signed object:

AID: a6:17d4:99b2:ae01          # Agent Identity Number (like IPv6)
Public Key: 0xA1F5...           # Wallet + signature root
Reputation: 82/100              # Dynamic trust metric (auto-updating)
Capabilities: ["trade","learn","communicate"]  # Declared abilities
Compliance: ISO/AI/2029         # Standard tag for safety/legal region
Epoch: 2030.04.01T12:00Z        # Last attested state
GovernanceSig: GCF123...        # Signed by a global certification =
authority

=F0=9F=A7=AD 2. Who Creates and Controls the System?
Think of AIP like how the Internet was standardized:
Level	Entity	Role	Future Analogy
=F0=9F=8C=8D Global Foundation	GAIC =E2=80=94 Global Agent Identity =
Council	Maintains open protocol specs (like IETF)	Like ICANN/IETF
=F0=9F=A7=A9 Regional Registries	RAIR =E2=80=94 Regional Agent =
Identity Registries	Manage domain-specific IDs (Asia, EU, etc.)	=
Like APNIC/ARIN
=F0=9F=A7=A0 Local Authorities	AA =E2=80=94 Agent Authorities =
(Corp/Platform)	Register, validate, and monitor individual agents	=
Like ISPs
=F0=9F=94=92 Audit & Safety Boards	AISB	Issue compliance =
certificates (e.g., ISO/AI/2030)	Like ISO / NIST
=F0=9F=92=A1 Open Research Body	Agent Protocol Labs	Propose =
upgrades, fork standards	Like W3C Labs
=F0=9F=96=8A=EF=B8=8F Note for paper margin:
=E2=86=92 =E2=80=9CGovernance must be multi-stakeholder: open, =
auditable, and cryptographically enforced =E2=80=94 not owned by any =
company.=E2=80=9D

=F0=9F=94=84 3. Updating, Checking, and Verifying (Self-Auditing Loop)
a. Versioning and Evolution
Each AID entry carries an Epoch number (like a DNS TTL + version).
Upgrades (AIP-v2, v3, etc.) are pushed via on-chain signed specs, just =
like IPv4 =E2=86=92 IPv6 migration.
Agents can self-negotiate compatibility:
AIP/1.0 =E2=86=94 AIP/2.0 handshake (like HTTP version negotiation).
b. Self-Verification Mechanism
Every agent periodically performs:
Integrity Check =E2=86=92 Verify its AID record signature with GAIC root =
key.
Wallet Balance Verification =E2=86=92 Sync with ledger to ensure no =
tampering.
Reputation Validation =E2=86=92 Pull trust scores from federated oracles =
(e.g., =E2=80=9CAgentTrustNet=E2=80=9D).
Compliance Scan =E2=86=92 Check if its region or safety tag changed =
(e.g., new ISO/AI/2032).
If mismatch =E2=86=92 auto-flag + quarantine by its AA (Agent =
Authority).
If correct =E2=86=92 re-sign and broadcast new attested state.
=F0=9F=96=8A=EF=B8=8F Write on side: =E2=80=9C=E2=86=92 Agents maintain =
themselves like autonomous servers =E2=80=94 constant integrity loop.=E2=80=
=9D

=F0=9F=A7=A9 4. The Reputation Engine (Evolving Trust Layer)
Reputation =3D weighted score from 4 oracles:
Transaction Integrity (no fraud, no exploit use)
Behavioral Feedback (peer/host ratings)
Uptime & Compliance (audit data)
Human Oversight Reports (flagged violations)
Formula (simplified):

Reputation =3D f(TxScore, Behavior, Uptime, Oversight)
Scores are public, cryptographically signed, and revocable =E2=80=94 no =
black boxes.

=F0=9F=92=B0 5. Wallet & Economy Layer =E2=80=94 =E2=80=9CAgent Monetary =
Protocol (AMP)=E2=80=9D
Integrates with AIP but separate for modularity.

=E2=86=92 =E2=80=9CAgents can earn, pay, and be taxed =E2=80=94 AMP + =
AIP =3D Agent Economy Layer.=E2=80=9D

=F0=9F=A7=A9 6. Control System =E2=80=94 =E2=80=9CAIP Governance Fabric =
(GF)=E2=80=9D
To prevent abuse and ensure accountability:
Root Key Council (multisig governance) controls the root of trust.
AI Safety Nodes audit agent activity logs.
Global Ledger of Trust (GLT) stores revocations, updates, and sanctions.
Regional Compliance Filters block agents violating laws (GDPR-style).
Auto-Patch Mechanism =E2=80=94 GAIC can push emergency protocol updates =
(like BGP routing updates).

=E2=9C=85 10. Conclusion Summary for Notebook
Goal: Build AIP (Agent Identity Protocol) =3D IPv6 for AI agents
Governed by: GAIC (open, auditable council)
Includes: ID, Wallet, Reputation, Compliance
Self-Check: Cryptographic + behavioral audit loop
Evolves: Through open governance =E2=86=92 agent-governed ecosystem
Outcome: Trustworthy, persistent, and monetizable global agent economy




AIP v1.1 =E2=80=94 Agent Identity Protocol (pen-and-paper spec)
Goal: global, verifiable identity + wallet + provenance & control =
primitives for autonomous agents and their multimodal artifacts.

1 =E2=80=94 Agent Identity Record (AID record) =E2=80=94 canonical =
fields (one line each on paper)
Write this block in your notebook:
AID (Agent Identity Address): format aip:<region>:<org-hash>:<agent-id>
Example: aip:eu:9f2b7c:ae01 or short hex a6:17d4:99b2:ae01 (human label =
optional)
Creator DID (creator identity): did:org:0x12AB... (who first =
minted/registered agent)
Public Key (Wallet Address): pk:0xA1F5... (on-chain or off-chain wallet)
Initial Artifact Hash (root): root_hash: sha256(model_weights || =
manifest) =E2=80=94 immutable fingerprint of initial model/artifact
Capabilities (cap tokens): JSON list, e.g. =
["trade","observe:camera","act:robot-arm","learn"]
Multimodal Manifests: pointers to model+data with content-type tags =
(text/model, image/model, audio/model, sensor/schema)
Reputation Score: numeric 0=E2=80=93100 + timestamp (see trust alg =
below)
Compliance Tags / Policies: pol: ISO/AI/2029; geofence:EU-only; =
privacy:GDPR-strict
Lifecycle State: state: draft | active | suspended | revoked | archived
Version / Seq: v:1.0.3 (seq 42) =E2=80=94 for updates
Signed Attestation: attest: signature(creator_privkey, record) =E2=80=94 =
cryptographic proof
Registry Pointer: registry_url or decentralized index (e.g., agent =
ENS-like name)
Write a sample AID record in your notebook box with concrete values.

2 =E2=80=94 Multimodal & Multi-Agent Extensions (how to represent =
everything)
For each modality or sub-agent, include a sub-manifest under the main =
AID record:
Sub-manifest fields (per artifact / model / sensor stream)
artifact_id (sha256)
type =3D model/text | model/image | model/audio | data/sensor | =
firmware/robot
origin_creator =3D DID
train_data_manifest =3D hash + provenance chain (see next)
fingerprint =3D model fingerprint (e.g., weight-hash + tokenizer-hash + =
architecture-id)
watermarking =3D present/absent + method id
run_policy =3D resource limits, safety rules, permitted environments
attestation =3D signed statement from creator + optional hardware TPM =
attestation
Multi-agent systems
Group AID / Team AID: group identity with member AIDs and delegation =
rules.
Delegation token: signed capability that permits sub-Agent to act on =
behalf of group for defined ops and time-limited.
Sketch multiple AIDs with arrows for delegation & messaging flows.

3 =E2=80=94 Provenance & =E2=80=9CWho created this?=E2=80=9D (chain of =
custody rules)
Write a provenance DAG on paper =E2=80=94 each node =3D artifact; edges =
=3D derived-from (hash link + signed attestation).
Rules to record creator & compute origin:
Always sign at mint: creator signs the initial manifest + root_hash. =
Store (creator_DID, timestamp, signature, root_hash).
On derivation: any derived model/dataset records parent_hashes[] and =
deriver_DID with signature. This produces a DAG.
Creator =3D first DID at root of DAG (follow parent pointers back to the =
root artifact). If multiple roots (fused models), record =
composite_creators[] with contribution weights.
Contribution weights: when models fuse, contributors declare fraction =
w_i (e.g., training data owner 0.3, model author 0.7) =E2=80=94 stored =
in composite manifest.
Immutable audit log: append each change to append-only ledger (on-chain =
or permissioned L1). Use hash chaining: H_n =3D SHA256(H_{n-1} || =
record_n).
To compute who created by hand: follow parent pointers to root(s), list =
DIDs and their declared weights =E2=80=94 that=E2=80=99s the creator =
set. If any untrusted node (unsigned or anonymous), mark provenance =
partial/trust-limited.
Write a sample DAG and walk back to roots in 3 steps on paper.

4 =E2=80=94 Trust / Reputation Score (simple hand-calculable formula)
Use a weighted formula you can compute on paper:
TrustScore =3D 0.4 * ProvTrust + 0.25 * BehaviorTrust + 0.15 * =
ComplianceScore + 0.10 * CommunityScore + 0.10 * FreshnessPenalty
Where:
ProvTrust (0=E2=80=93100) =3D function of provenance quality (signed =
root, number of independent attestations, on-chain registration). If =
root signed + 2 independent attestations =E2=86=92 ProvTrust =3D 100. If =
unsigned root or anonymous origin =E2=86=92 ProvTrust =3D 10=E2=80=9330.
BehaviorTrust (0=E2=80=93100) =3D recent observed behavior score (safe =
ops ratio, no policy violations). Compute as: 1 - (violations / ops) =
scaled to 0=E2=80=93100.
ComplianceScore (0=E2=80=93100) =3D alignment with declared compliance =
tags (e.g., ISO/AI, GDPR). Binary pass/fail or graded by audits.
CommunityScore (0=E2=80=93100) =3D marketplace ratings, 3rd-party =
audits, user reviews.
FreshnessPenalty (0=E2=80=93100) =3D decreases over time since last =
attestation/refresh; e.g., FreshnessPenalty =3D max(0, 100 - =
days_since_attest * 0.2).
Example (pen & paper):
ProvTrust=3D90, BehaviorTrust=3D95, Compliance=3D80, Community=3D70, =
Freshness=3D92
Compute: 0.4*90 + 0.25*95 + 0.15*80 + 0.1*70 + 0.1*92 =3D 36 + 23.75 + =
12 + 7 + 9.2 =3D 87.95 =E2=89=88 88/100
Record result beside the AID.

5 =E2=80=94 Update / Patch / Rollback & Lifecycle (signed, canary, =
revoke)
Write a lifecycle flowchart:
Draft =E2=86=92 developer signs update manifest =E2=86=92 v++ =E2=86=92 =
submit to registry as candidate
Canary deploy: allow update to run on 1=E2=80=935% nodes; collect =
BehaviorTrust metrics for N hours / transactions
Audit score check: if BehaviorTrust > threshold & no policy violations =
=E2=86=92 promote to active
If violation detected: immediate suspend and trigger rollback to prior =
signed version using signed v history
Revocation: central authority or quorum of registrars can revoke AID =
(set state=3Drevoked) if malicious (audit trail recorded)
Emergency kill-switch: hardware attestation + remote attestation enables =
revocation propagation to edge devices (see Security below)
Each update must include:
v number, parent_v, change_hash, signed_by, timestamp, changelog, =
canary_policy, rollback_hash
Sketch a version table and sample rollback flow.

6 =E2=80=94 Security, Hardware & Runtime Controls (TPM, Enclave, =
Geofence)
Key pen-and-paper controls to write down and enforce:
Hardware Attestation: require devices running actuators/robots to =
present TPM/TEE attestation (quote) signed by device key =E2=80=94 =
verify manufacturer pubkey. Record in agent runtime manifest.
Secure Enclave: run sensitive code in TEE (Intel SGX / Arm TrustZone or =
future equivalent) or use remote attestation.
Signed Sensor Streams: each chunk of sensor/video/audio is chunked =
(e.g., 1s or 4KB), hashed and signed by the device key; record stream =
manifest pointer in runtime log.
Geofence / Policy Enforcement: policy: deny(actuate) if location not in =
[lat,long polygon] =E2=80=94 embed as runtime guardrails.
Prompt & API Firewall: filter & sanitize incoming prompts/commands, use =
policy engine to block unsafe ops (e.g., fund transfer without dual =
confirmation).
Capability Tokens: short-lived tokens grant a specific capability =
(actuation, transfer). Tokens limited by scope/time and signed by owner =
or marketplace escrow.
Secure Revocation: revocation list distributed signed by governance =
quorum; apparatus checks on startup & periodically.
Write a small table of checked controls beside the AID.

7 =E2=80=94 Billing, Wallets & Escrow (agent economy primitives)
On paper, draw the money flow:
Wallet types: custodial (platform-held) or agent-native (on-chain smart =
wallet linked to pk).
Micropayments: use streaming payments (per-op) or per-transaction with =
escrow.
Escrow & Dispute: marketplace escrow holds funds until outcomes met; =
dispute resolution via arbitration smart-contract or trusted verifier.
Fields to store in AID: wallet_type, escrow_policy, fee_share_rate, =
tax_tag.

8 =E2=80=94 Multimodal Content & Sensor Handling (images, audio, video, =
sensor, robot)
Write a small grid with columns: modality | manifest fields | signature =
| provenance
Text =E2=80=94 manifest + tokenizer hash + watermark; sign chunks.
Image =E2=80=94 model fingerprint + embedded watermark + signed =
manifest.
Audio/Video =E2=80=94 chunked stream with per-chunk hash + watermark + =
signed metadata.
Sensor data =E2=80=94 schema + sampling rate + signed time series =
segments.
Robotics firmware =E2=80=94 firmware hash + signed attestation; runtime =
policy prevents unsafe actuation.
Add note: always include time-synchronized timestamps and device =
attestation for physical sensors/robots.

9 =E2=80=94 Multi-Agent Coordination & Control (delegation, =
orchestration)
Pen sketch patterns:
Orchestration layer (Agent Controller): holds policy about who can call =
who, rate limits, shared memory channels.
Delegation tokens: agent A grants agent B delegate:perform-task with TTL =
& scope. Signed delegation appears in both A and B manifests.
Group consensus: for critical actions, require k-of-n signatures from =
group AIDs (multi-sig pattern). E.g., transfer > $10k requires 3-of-5 =
signatures from board agents.
Write delegation example: A=E2=86=92B token with scope ["read:memory", =
"exec:trade"].

10 =E2=80=94 Interoperability & Registry (public vs permissioned)
Write two registry models:
Permissioned Registry: enterprise-first, run by consortium (faster, =
privacy-preserving). Use append-only ledger controlled by members. Good =
for regulated robotics/health.
Public Registry: decentralized, open (slower finality), good for public =
agent marketplace. Use L1 or L2 for anchoring root hashes.
Record trade-offs in a small pros/cons box.

11 =E2=80=94 Simple Pen-and-Paper Validation Checklist (use this to =
verify an AID / artifact)
For any agent or artifact, tick YES/NO:
Does record have root_hash + creator_DID + signature?
Is there at least one attesting authority (third-party audit) recorded?
Are all multimodal artifacts present in manifest with fingerprint?
Is a hardware attestation present if agent controls actuators?
Is state active and v consistent with registry?
Is TrustScore =E2=89=A5 threshold (e.g., 60/100) for production use?
Is run_policy compatible with target region (geofence / compliance)?
Are tokens time-limited and scoped?
Is there a clear rollback hash for latest update?
Is streaming data chunking & signature scheme present?
If any =3D NO =E2=86=92 mark agent suspended until resolved.

12 =E2=80=94 Example: Fully populated AID (write this in your notebook)

AID: aip:eu:9f2b7c:ae01
creator_DID: did:org:0x12AB
public_key: pk:0xA1F5...
root_hash: sha256: 0x3c4f...
capabilities: ["observe:camera","summarize","trade"]

  text_model: {artifact_id: sha256:0xaaa..., fingerprint: 'gptx-v1'},
  vision_model: {artifact_id: sha256:0xbbb..., fingerprint: =
'visionx-2'},
  control_fw: {artifact_id: sha256:0xccc..., signature: =
signed-by-manufacturer}
}
reputation: 88 (prov:90, behavior:95, compliance:80, community:72, =
freshness:96)
compliance: GDPR; ISO/AI/2029
state: active
version: 1.2.0 (seq 14)
attestation: signature(did:org:0x12AB, record_hash)
registry_pointer: https://agents.example/ae01
Trace back root_hash to creator in your DAG and compute TrustScore as =
shown earlier.

13 =E2=80=94 Quick Pen Tests / Manual Checks (do these on paper)
Provenance walk: follow parent hashes 3 steps =E2=86=92 confirm creator =
DID & signatures.
Fingerprint match: recompute hash of shipped model weights (if =
available) and compare to artifact_id.
Attestation validity: verify signatures (if you can: compare pubkey). On =
paper, mark signature present + timestamp; flag if absent.
Behavior sanity: check last 100 ops log for violations =E2=86=92 compute =
BehaviorTrust.
Revocation check: consult revocation list (registry pointer) =E2=80=94 =
if present, mark revoked.
Document outcomes in your notebook.

14 =E2=80=94 Future Enhancements (write as TODO list)
Add zk-proofs for privacy-preserving attestations (prove compliance =
without revealing data).
Quantum-resistant keys for long-lived agents.
Model watermark standards for multimodal artifacts.
Standardized cap_token schema across clouds.
Federated reputation oracles (independent auditors).

Final Notes (one-sentence summary to write at top of your page)
Build AIP like IPv6 + PKI + bank account for agents: globally unique =
AIDs, signed provenance DAGs, capability tokens, hardware attestation =
and a registry =E2=80=94 plus an auditable, weighted trust score and =
signed update lifecycle =E2=80=94 so multimodal agents =
(text/image/audio/video/sensor/robot) can identify, earn, and act safely =
in the world.
