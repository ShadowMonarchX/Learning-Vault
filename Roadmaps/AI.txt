Here are some **interview questions** (with brief explanations) based on your project:

---

## 🔐 **Project: Full-Stack Authentication System using Django and React**

### ✅ **General Questions**

1. **What is JWT and how does it work in your authentication system?**

   * Explain how JWT is generated after login, sent to the frontend, stored (e.g. localStorage), and used to authorize future API requests.

2. **Why did you choose Django REST Framework (DRF) for the backend?**

   * Mention benefits like built-in support for token-based auth, serialization, viewsets, etc.

3. **How do you handle secure storage of the JWT token on the client side?**

   * Talk about using `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or `HttpOnly cookies`, and discuss pros/cons (e.g. XSS risks).

4. **How do you protect API endpoints using JWT in Django?**

   * Explain how you added `IsAuthenticated` or custom permission classes and how tokens are checked in request headers.

---

### ✅ **Frontend (React) Questions**

5. **How does React communicate with the Django backend in your project?**

   * Through Axios or Fetch API to send HTTP requests, with JWT in headers for protected routes.

6. **How do you manage authentication state in React?**

   * Talk about storing the JWT in state/localStorage, using `useContext` or a state manager like Redux for auth state.

7. **What happens when a user logs out?**

   * Explain how the JWT token is removed from storage and the frontend is redirected or state reset.

---

### ✅ **Backend (Django/DRF) Questions**

8. **How did you implement user registration and login in Django?**

   * Talk about using `APIView` or `ViewSet`, `UserSerializer`, and generating JWT upon successful login.

9. **How do you handle token expiration and refresh?**

   * If using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`, explain how refresh tokens work and how tokens are renewed.

10. **What middleware or packages did you use for authentication?**

* Mention `SimpleJWT`, `djangorestframework`, CORS headers, etc.

---

### ✅ **Security & Best Practices**

11. **How do you prevent unauthorized access to frontend routes?**

* Discuss route protection using conditional rendering or private routes in React.

12. **What security measures did you implement to protect user data?**

* Mention password hashing, HTTPS, CORS settings, XSS/CSRF protection (if applicable).

13. **Did you face any CORS issues? How did you fix them?**

* Explain how Django CORS headers were set up (`django-cors-headers`) to allow frontend communication.

---

### ✅ Bonus/Advanced

14. **What would you improve in your current authentication system?**

* Suggest using refresh tokens securely, adding email verification, 2FA, or switching to OAuth.

15. **How would you scale this system in production?**

* Add secure token storage (cookies), rate limiting, use NGINX/Load Balancer, environment variables, etc.

Would you like **answers** for these as well in interview style? Or a **PDF summary** for your prep?














Here are key **interview questions (with context)** based on your project:

---

## 🏠 **Project: Bangalore Home Price Prediction (End-to-End ML Project)**

### ✅ **General Questions**

1. **What was the objective of this project?**

   * Explain: Predict house prices in Bangalore using ML based on features like location, size, and square footage.

2. **What dataset did you use and how did you collect it?**

   * Talk about the CSV dataset (from Kaggle or similar), its structure, and how you loaded it using Pandas.

---

### ✅ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

3. **What steps did you take during data cleaning?**

   * Removing missing values, handling categorical variables (like location), removing outliers (like unrealistic sqft per room), etc.

4. **How did you handle outliers?**

   * You might mention removing data points where price per square foot was far from the mean or filtering based on bedroom-to-bathroom ratios.

5. **How did you convert categorical features like location into numerical format?**

   * Using one-hot encoding (with `pd.get_dummies()`), and handling high cardinality by grouping rare locations into “other”.

---

### ✅ **Model Building**

6. **Which machine learning algorithm did you use and why?**

   * Linear Regression – simple, interpretable, good for numeric prediction.

7. **How did you evaluate the model’s performance?**

   * Using metrics like RMSE, R² score, train/test split for validation.

8. **Did you try any other models?**

   * If yes, mention decision trees or random forest. If no, explain why Linear Regression was sufficient.

---

### ✅ **Model Deployment & Integration**

9. **How did you integrate the ML model with the frontend?**

   * Using **Flask** as a backend API, exposing a `/predict` route that takes input and returns the predicted price.

10. **What technology did you use for the frontend?**

* Simple HTML/CSS form for inputs like location, area, bedrooms, and a submit button to get predictions from Flask.

11. **How does the user interact with your app?**

* Describe: User fills the form → clicks submit → Flask API gets the input → model predicts → result shown.

---

### ✅ **Code & Architecture**

12. **How is your project structured (folders/files)?**

* E.g. `app.py` for Flask, `model.pkl` for saved model, `utils.py` for preprocessing, `templates/` for HTML, etc.

13. **How did you save and load your trained model?**

* Used `pickle` or `joblib` to serialize the trained model and load it in Flask during prediction.

---

### ✅ **Advanced / Optional**

14. **How would you improve this project if given more time?**

* Add a better frontend (React), use more advanced models (XGBoost), deploy with Docker or on cloud, include more features like nearby amenities.

15. **How would you deploy this project to production?**

* Use cloud platforms (like AWS, Heroku), add Docker container, use Gunicorn + NGINX for serving Flask, secure inputs.
